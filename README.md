## About

This project uses both `apollo-server` and `apollo-server-lambda` so that you can write your GraphQL resolvers and type definitions in one place, yet run GraphQL servers locally and serverlessly.

## Notes

Used [serverless-graphql-netlify-starter](https://github.com/stemmlerjs/serverless-graphql-netlify-starter) as a starter.
